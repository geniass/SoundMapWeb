SoundMapWeb
===========

Go [here](http://soundmap.herokuapp.com) to see the heatmap

This is a Ruby on Rails web app to render data gathered by https://github.com/geniass/SoundHeatmap and display it as a heatmap on top of a Google Maps satellite image. It's a bit rough at the moment (no login/auth, probably some bugs)

External libraries used:
* Ruby on Rails Framework
* Twitter Bootstrap (so it doesn't look like cr...)
* JQuery
* Heatmap.js (www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs)
